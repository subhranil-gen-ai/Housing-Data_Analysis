# Housing-Data_Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis and ML-ready preprocessing on the Housing dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, and¬†Scikit-learn.

# üè° Housing Data Analysis
This project performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and *preprocessing* on the Housing dataset. It includes real-world techniques to clean, explore, visualize, and prepare the data for machine learning.
